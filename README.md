Test for the ultrasonic sensors used with the arduino. 

Plug the trigPin on pin 2 and the echo pin on pin 4. They should be indicated on the sensor. 
Otherwise check the documentation of your sensors

Plug the arduino, verify that the proper board and proper usb are selected. 

Upload the test and run it. 
Open the serial monitor and verify than the serial communication is similar to the one written (9600). 

Check the results which should reflect on the distance of the objects. 
If the distance is about 3000 whatever you put in front of the sensor, it might be damaged.
